# Contributing to SurvivalAnalysis.jl

This package is still in the very early stages of development so the guidelines here are a simple placeholder.

Currently the package is maintained and coded by me, Raphael Sonabend (<raphaelsonabend@gmail.com>). I welcome any and all contributions, these may include:

* Opening bug reports and feature requests/enhancements in the [issues](https://github.com/RaphaelS1/SurvivalAnalysis.jl/issues) tracker
* Opening [pull requests](https://github.com/RaphaelS1/SurvivalAnalysis.jl/pulls) that may close open issues, implement new features, or fix bugs that you've found
* Opening [discussions](https://github.com/RaphaelS1/SurvivalAnalysis.jl/discussions) about new or existing features
* Commenting on open issues, pull requests, or discussions

I appreciate contributing to a project may sometimes feel daunting, so please feel free to reach out to me and schedule a call if you'd like to chat before making your first contribution.
